> 2.  Run both the executables chromedriver and educative_scraper by downloading them from latest releases.

      Note: If the executable release version is older than the current github repo version then run the
            project manually explained below.

> 3.  Select a config if you don't want to use the default config "0" by pressing 2.

      Note: Make sure to generate the config if it is selected for the first time.

> 4.  Generate the config (if not created) and provide the urls text file path, save location and headless mode by pressing 1.

> 5.  Login your educative account by pressing 3.
> 6.  Start Scraping by pressing 4.
> 7.  To return to Main Menu/ Exit Scraper press Ctrl+C / CMD+C.

#### Note 1: If the scraper fails or the User Exits in between for any specific reason, a log.txt file will be created in the save path, containing the index and last known url while scraping, copy the {index url} and replace it in the urls text file to resume scraping the course where it was stopped previously by restarting the scraper.

#### Note 2: Make sure to delete the urls that are already scraped while replacing in the urls text file.

#### Note 3: If for any reason your system shuts down for power failure or the scraper crashes then you have to manually search the url and index and provide the {index url} in urls text file since the scraper cannot create log.txt for sudden power cut/ crash.

## To Run the project manually using git and python:

### Prerequisites:

      Git
      Python 3.9+
      OS: Win/Mac(Intel)/Linux(ARM/AMD) 64bit
      Replace the word "python3" with "python" and "pip3" with "pip" for Windows OS only.

### Step 1: Clone the repository and create a terminal inside the cloned directory and run the following commands.

### Step 2: Install the virtualenv package for python3 and create a virtual environment named "env".

      pip3 install virtualenv
      python -m virtualenv env

### Step 3: Activate the virtual environment.

#### > (For Windows)

      env\Scripts\activate

#### > (For MacOS/Linux)

      source env/bin/activate

### Step 4: Install the required modules:

      pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### Step 5: Download, extract and paste the respective Chrome-bin for your OS from the latest releases section inside the Chrome-bin folder.

### Step 6: Open up two terminals and run the following commands in separate terminals.

      python chromedriver.py
      python educative_scraper.py

### Step 7: Refer, **[How to use the Scraper?](#how-to-use-the-scraper)** explained above, except the 2nd point.

#### For Mac OS users only: Refer to [this Repository](https://github.com/anilabhadatta/enable-disable-chrome-updates) to Disable Chrome Updates.

## (Optional) To Build the chromedriver and educative-scraper executables using pyinstaller:

#### Activate the Virtual Environment and Install the required modules for the project (Refer Step 2, 3, 4 above).

#### Install the pyinstaller package and run the following commands.

      pip3 install pyinstaller

#### > (For Windows)

      pyinstaller --clean --add-data Chrome-bin;Chrome-bin --onefile -i"icon.ico" educative_scraper.py
      pyinstaller --clean --add-data "Chrome-driver;Chrome-driver" --onefile -i"icon.ico" chromedriver.py

#### > (For MacOS/Linux)

      pyinstaller --clean --add-data Chrome-bin:Chrome-bin --onefile -i"icon.ico" educative_scraper.py
      pyinstaller --clean --add-data "Chrome-driver:Chrome-driver" --onefile -i"icon.ico" chromedriver.py

Pyinstaller command for Linux OS may or may not work due to a pyinstaller bug, currently checking for a fix.\
A Whitepaper will be released containing the explanation of each functions and the cases handled by the scraper.
